# immobility
Analysis of immobility from polybox videos analyzed with DeepLabCut (DLC).
Standard protocol from Busquets-Garcia Lab.

## Before starting
- Download the python scripts from this repository.
- Create a folder in your computer named **Python**.
- Inside **Python** create the following folders:
  - **Freezing periods**. It will contain the generated freezing periods of each video, stored as CSV files.
  - **Figures**. In this folder, you'll store your plots.
  - **Data**. You have to create the following folders:
    - **dat**. Here you have to store the the DAT files generated by the polybox.
    - **dlc**. And here, you need to put the CSV files generated by DLC.
    - **videos**. Finally, here you have to store the AVI videos from the polybox.

To sum up, this is what you need to start:

| Folder | directory | content |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Python | /python/ |  |
| Freezing Periods | /Python/Freezing Periods/ | empty |
| Figures | /Python/Figures/ | empty |
| Data | /Python/Data/ |  |
| dat | /Python/Data/dat/ | DAT files from the polybox |
| dlc | /Python/Data/dlc/ | CSV files from the DLC |
| videos | /Python/Data/videos/ | AVI files from the polybox |
